        <h1 class="headding">The MINDS Foundation</h1>
        <p>Founded in 2010, The MINDs Foundation is headquartered in Nizamabad, and has locations in Mumbai, Vadodara and Bhavnagar. Since its inception, the organisation has been working tirelessly to increase awareness around mental illness and provide more access to healthcare. Committed to eliminating the stigma that surrounds mental illness in India, it follows a three-phase approach. The first phase shines the spotlight on the importance of education. The MINDS Foundation has started a program to educate communities in villages across India. With the help of social workers, MINDs staff and Community Mental Health Workers, they raise awareness about the basics of mental illness and the effectiveness of treatment. In the second phase, they focus on effective, free treatment for any mentally ill person, and in last phase, the team works with each patient post-treatment to reintegrate them into their local communities.</p>
